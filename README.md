# SL-RAT-PROJECT

## Description of dataset

This dataset contains the data from Baltimore County Sewer System SL-RAT Scores.SL-RAT is an acoustic technology that provides blockage measurement within the pipeline and collects data between 0 to 10. Scores between 0 to 3 indicate the sewer line has a blockage and needs to be clean. SL-RAT scores help to identify the pipelines that need to be clean first. SL_RAT Analysis project will analyze SL-RAT Sewer System tool degradation over time and predict when the SL- RAT scores would be 0. That would help Baltimore County work on cleaning assessments more timely of overall sewer systems.
