# SL-RAT-PROJECT

## Description of dataset

This dataset contains the data from Baltimore County Sewer System SL-RAT Scores.SL-RAT is an acoustic technology that provides blockage measurement within the pipeline and collects data between 0 to 10. Scores between 0 to 3 indicate the sewer line has a blockage and needs to be clean. SL-RAT scores help to identify the pipelines that need to be clean first. SL_RAT Analysis project will analyze SL-RAT Sewer System tool degradation over time and predict when the SL- RAT scores would be 0. That would help Baltimore County work on cleaning assessments more timely of overall sewer systems.


## Problem Statement 

Determine the SL-RAT degradation rate and SL-RAT scores to maximize the efficiency of sewer preventive maintenance operations and system owner financial, staff and equipment resources.


## Results

I have tested several models for the SL-RAT Project. But, unfortunately, I couldn't get any good results. One of the problems I struggled with during the project was that I didn't have enough quality data. Also, the target value looks independent of the input features. I will try to get more data and add new features from other tables. Currently I don't have these data. 

My company is really interested in this project so they will support me continuing on this project.
